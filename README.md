# Kanban

## Kanban Webapp

Kanban is the latest project that I'm currently working on. Inspired by Trello and Asana, I wanted to create a Kanban Borad style app.  
The project is currently at a very early stage and I'll be adding more featureas in the upcoming weeks/months.
I've used ajax to submit forms and to send data to the MySQL database. I've used Bootstrap to fastrack the UI design.

### Desired functionality

- Users authentication
- Users can:
  - Create an account
  - Create, Update and Delete boards
  - Create, Update and Delete columns and cards
  - Rearrange columns and cards
  - Delete their own account
- Each board can have several columns just like a Kanban board
- Each column can have several cards
- Cards can be rearranged within the same column or moved to a different column altogheter.
- Cards have settings that can be modified such us tag colour, due date, etc.
